# Post-Operative-ML-RandomForest

A machine learning model based on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm was built to predict whether patients in a post-operative recovery area should be sent home or to a general hospital floor based on several attributes including: patient’s internal temperature, patient’s surface temperature, oxygen saturation, last BP reading, stability level of patient’s surface and core temperature, stability of patient’s BP, and the patient’s perceived comfort level at discharge.
